# Overview

This is the successor of the deprecated [exozet/php-fpm](https://hub.docker.com/r/exozet/php-fpm/) docker image. We collected ideas on how a new (including breaking changes) version of our heavily used php-fpm image could look like.

We figured that our old approach had some disadvantages (it was a php-fpm build based on [official docker php images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php)):

* it is based on a source build from php, so we could not use any packages from alpine/debian to speed up the build time
* there are differences between the php package on debian/alpine 
* there is no official alpine apache2 build
* we cannot add nginx unit to alpine build, as it lacks php embed SAPI [comment on php!1355](https://github.com/docker-library/php/pull/1355#issuecomment-1352087633)
* the non-alpine image has lots of (fixable) CVEs, we cannot fix (e.g. trivy image --ignore-unfixed php:8.1.13-fpm-buster says: Total: 23)
* depends on what the docker library team thinks fits into a docker image for php, it is not the php team releasing it

The new approach has some advantages:

* It uses the latest package distributed by alpine team/community (which is pretty fast when it comes to security updates - 1 or 2 days after release)
* The precompiled packages (e.g. xdebug) are very fast installed
* No need for custom scripts like [docker-php-ext-install](https://github.com/docker-library/php/blob/master/docker-php-ext-install)
* It ships with httpd binary (for apache2), unitd binary (for nginx unit) and php-fpm binary (for php fpm) to execute php web requests
* For apache2 and nginx unit variants an external webserver (like nginx) is not necessary anymore 
* It ships linux/arm64/v8 and linux/amd64 version of the image
* The web server and the web requests are executed as non-privileged user www-data
* The github release notes (including tool versions and php extension versions) is automatically generated if a commit is tagged
* The release is available only as endava/php:8.1.16 (no suffix for -root, -xdebug -alpine or -sudo or others)
* The CI/CD pipeline includes tests to validate the image as nginx unit or apache2 delivery
* The CI/CD pipeline only builds the latest version (if necessary we can git checkout -b 8.1.13 if you really want to fix something in a release)

The new approach has also some disadvantages:

* It does not support debian. If we want to do it: we need to do the same approach for debian based on official repositories.
* We depend on the release of php packages at alpine (e.g. on 2023/01/03 the php82 was not officially packaged on alpine including nginx unit - so we cannot support it. at the same time it is available as docker image on official docker php). If the packaged package version number is not available on alpine anymore - we cannot recreate the docker image (we have a workaround to build older apk's for it - takes more time, but is 100% viable solution!)
